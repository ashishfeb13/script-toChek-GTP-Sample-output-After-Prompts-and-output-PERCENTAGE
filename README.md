# script-toChek-GTP-Sample-output-After-Prompts-and-output-PERCENTAGE

The script reads an input file and counts the occurrences of each keyword in a case-insensitive manner. It then calculates the percentage of each keyword and saves the results to an output file. Additionally, it generates a pie chart showing the percentage distribution of the keywords.

# Keyword Percentage Calculator

This script calculates the percentage of occurrences of keywords ('Algae', 'Virus', 'Bacteria', 'Fungi') in a text file.

## Usage

```bash
./script.sh input_file.txt

**# Dependencies**

    python3
    matplotlib (for graph generation)

**# Example**

Suppose input_file.txt contains the following text:
  Algae Virus Bacteria Virus Algae Fungi Virus Algae
Running the script with this input file (./script.sh input_file.txt) will produce the following output:
Algae: 37.50%
Virus: 37.50%
Bacteria: 12.50%
Fungi: 12.50%
A pie chart showing the distribution of the keywords will also be generated.
